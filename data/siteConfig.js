  authorDescription: `Hi, I’m Joel, thanks for visiting my website. I’m a Full-Stack Software Engineer working primarily in front and back end web application & REST API development. As a life-long learner, I continue to actively study to expand my skill set as a developer and deepen my understanding of the surrounding disciplines in the computer science field, primarily Security and DevOps. Something to know about me is that I have excellent work ethic and thrive in a team setting where I can work with and learn from my coworkers. I take enormous pride and ownership in the outcomes of my teams and am always willing to put in the extra effort to ensure we all attain our goals. I’m always interested in hearing about cool projects and opportunities so please don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you would like to talk.`,
